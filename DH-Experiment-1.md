# Outline of Assignment + Preliminary Plans
march 21st
## Assignment Overview
- a lab notebook with at least 10 entries; this notebook is a gift to **future you** when you try to replicate or revisit what you’ve learned
    - this will be a private repository on Github to which you’ll add **shawngraham** as a collaborator.
    - each entry will be a markdown file with a name along these lines ‘yyyy-mm-dd-entry#.md’
    - bullet points etc are fine; these are not essays. They are your _notes_. They can contain images, links, screenshots, to do lists, things that are working, workflows, reference literature etc
- an [unessay](https://people.uleth.ca/~daniel.odonnell/teaching/the-unessay) discussing the experiment, in a format appropriate to the work (thus, not necessarily a written essay)
	- choose your own topic
	- present it however you please
	- evaluation on how compelling and effective it is

## Idea
- AI girlfriend experiment, making an AI girlfriend based on media and stuff
	- SDV dialogue, movie scripts
- a number of different AI girlfriends
- AI girlfriend to girlfriend communication

#### My Question: *Can using data from scripts and other media sources distill patriarchal influences that might help us glean how AI chatbots are trained to resemble "girlfriends"?*

## To-Do
- first, figure out the code
- isolate movie dialogue
- plan the rest
- different AI girlfriend iterations
	- make scripted questions to ask each iteration
	- observe behaviour
- put two AI in conversation? maybe beyond my scope here
- unessay about the experience
	- github page?
- get on AI girlfriend discord to see user discussion maybe?
