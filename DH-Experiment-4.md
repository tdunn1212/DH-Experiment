# This time...
- First, I am going to try and run the Flinders Petrie code in VSCode, and if that works, I am going to modify it to run a script from Her... hopefully! It's a first attempt, but I feel like this angle will give me a lot more to work with, and if it goes well, I can add more movie scripts
- I chose Her (2014) because I feel like it's pretty on the nose for a man falling in love with an AI

# Progress
- I was able to download the Jupyter Notebook files, but I had to do a lot of research/messing around/asking ChatGPT a couple of times to get the code to work properly. Finally, after successfully performing the test with the revised code (which took a while and is the main downside from doing things locally, I definitely underestimated what kind of GPU an LLM needs!), I moved onto making the code again for my purposes with the Her script
- with programming support from ChatGPT  (I definitely want to get better at programming through all this), I got to making a function that combs through *Her's* script to take dialogue from Samantha to put in a separate text file![](/images/4-08-04)
	- In future work, I will have to work to accommodate special characters and double check for errors
- Finally, I adapted the code from Practical Necromancy to my purposes, before doing a test training on GPT2 to teach it Samantha's style![](/images/4-08-05)
- Ta-Da!![](/images/4-08-06)
- Definitely still not perfect, but I feel like this step has increased my confidence a lot and given me some foundational opportunities to take next steps and build on this

# Next Steps
- Add in lines from other sources and combine them into one big txt file
- more indepth training to further sophisticate the model as much as I can
