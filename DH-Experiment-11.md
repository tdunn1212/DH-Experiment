## My Question: *Can using data from scripts and other media sources distill patriarchal influences that might help us glean how AI chatbots are trained to resemble "girlfriends"?*
##### My answer.... kind of? 
- So far, this is more conceptual work that speaks to patriarchal domination in cultural narratives
- but with a model this small and rudimentary that is so easily trained on only 7 different texts, we can definitely make inferences about the larger and more conversational AI models
- To answer this question, I want to continue to work on this project, getting to more sophisticated ways of training and a chat bot interface, which I'd argue is responsible for a large part of the illusory element of the AI relationship dynamic
- However, sources like scripts are no doubt a small part of the data used to train AI GF LLMs, and if this media perpetuates patriarchal stereotypes, no doubt LLMs are consistently trained on information like this
