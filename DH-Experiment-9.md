# This Time
- I'm revising my training, getting rid of the FF7 characters and adding dialogue from two rom-coms, *500 Days of Summer* and *You've Got Mail.*
- If need be, I may add more to be safe
- I want to see if this improves the training of my model

# Progress
- Like I've done before, I added the scripts and dialogues from my two movies to my code and started training
- Because of the issues I'm having with Colab (see last entry), I'm having to use VSCode, which means that I'm only training with 100 steps and it will take a while. For my next run, presuming I get okay results, I'll go back to using Colab and try to find a workaround

- this is definitely improvement from last time! there are still some incoherencies, but i think at this point i would have to undergo deeper investigation to remedy that, or find a way to increased model sophistication
- either way, i'll work with what i have for now and undergo deeper examination following this particular experiment
- I think I have sufficient data to train my model in more detail and adjust the model's output to see what results I can get

# Next Time
- Trying to train the model in detail one more time to get results that may/may not answer my question
