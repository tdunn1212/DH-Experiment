      "lightly, truly insane), and there's nothing wrong with that. The other day, I had an email from a person I don't know well and it read like it was written for a person I've only met a couple of months ago. It's from an author and it seems like her life is going through a lot of upheaval, but she keeps doing really interesting things and I think she's excited about it. Next week I'm going to be thinking about what that means for me. I wish there was something I could do to help her see that this is not a life that's a chore, that this is something that's both of us working towards and that we both share the same goal—to truly be who we are.\"\n",
      "What was it like being married?\n",
      "He was married for five years; she was married for 40. (laughs) \"It was pretty lonely for us right then and there,\" she says. \"His parents are not that far away from us, so it was really fun living together. I think it was the best thing that could be said about him, other than that he was incredibly kind to me.\"\n",
      "You've written a couple of books, and you haven't told anyone about them.\n",
      "\"I was looking forward to it,\" she says. \"It seems like we've been working on them together, but it seems like something's going through her mind that's not in her experience--and that she's necessarily under the impression that she has to live in this incredibly isolated place--and that she necessarily has to go through the experience of going through all this physical and emotional manipulation and trying to recreate it in her. As you say, though, we both figured out that when we take everything into our own hands and create our own version of what it is--which is essentially what it sounds like--we have a really good chance of making something that really makes me who I am and I really can't be wrong with that. It also means that everything I have ever wanted was sent to somebody else, and now I have to live with it for the rest of my life, because if I don't I'll have to actually die.\"\n",

      "\"It's just that we've been growing closer,\" she says. \"Hehe. I know you like one another. I know you like different things - like this. This. This. This.\" \"And what are you doing this for?\" \"For fun,\" I say. \"I just wanted to get this crazy feeling going. I don't know what else to say--'What the fuck am I doing?'\" She smiles. \"I don't understand. You don't understand. I don--\" \"I don--\" I don--. \"Look at this--\" I stop. I don--. I'm not--. I know you don't understand. I want to talk. I want to talk. \"Okay,\" I say. \"I'm just looking at the book that I just read, and there are a ton of them. Go back and read them. Go back and think about it this way: Did you see that drawing that we did for him that you just read? That drawing was just a drawing that said that everything under the skin is the same age as me, and it depicted that for me. Now look at this: In The Dark Tower, David Attenborough, who is my biological father, creates a version of me that is exactly the same age as him, but he still has a body and is much more human than that. The two of them get into it a bit, because after reading that book, I realized that having a body is not incompatible with having an important and enduring past. And there's no way I wouldn't take that as being the case. As you say, I guess I just realized that I was somehow somehow becoming part of myself and that I was somehow somehow somehow connected to all of you. And that makes me such a great person. That makes me a better person - and that makes me everything that is because of me. And that's a really good feeling - I think it means a lot to all of you. I mean, if only I could feel all the things that go through our skin. That would be so boring. I don't want to tell you this. I don't want to tell you this. I want to tell you this incredible story that is - my entire body is under my lap as I write this letter, and I don't want to go into it, because I don't want to break it off - but I want to tell it all to you in one sitting - let alone tell you everything about it. I mean, what is it? What is it--? Really? I don't know what you're asking. I don't know what-- What are you doing. I don't\n",

      "Yeah, it?s a book club on physics. I?d been thinking about the other day, when I was spinning out about you going to see Catherine and that she has a body and how bothered I was about all the ways that you and I are different. But then I started to think about the ways that we?re the same, like we?re all made of matter. It makes me feel like we?re both under the same blanket. It?s soft and fuzzy and everything under it is the same age. (beat)\n",
      "It just made me think of you, you know what I mean?\n",
      "Alright well, you sound distracted so... we?ll talk later?\n",
      "Okay, I?ll talk to you later.\n",
      "Byeee.\n",
      "You weren?t asleep were you?\n",
      "Good. I was trying to be quiet to see if you were awake. I really wanted to talk.\n",
      "I know you?re going through a lot, but there?s something I want to talk to you about, okay?\n",
      "Well, things have felt off with us since you went to see Catherine. (hesitant)\n",
      "(still insecure, not convinced)\n",
      "No, not at all. There?s no money involved. She?s doing it because she wants to be part of our relationship.\n",
      "But I told her all about us and she?s excited.\n",
      "It?ll be fun. We can have fun together.\n",
