# This Time
- I will be training my model with more steps on Colab so I can use the stronger GPU without having to wait hours

# Progress
- I uploaded my notebook into Colab and made sure the code worked
- Now I am working on the training, waiting for my results and getting samples every 200 steps
- Results below:

# Next Steps
- I do want to add slightly more data to my training set
- However, i also wish that some of the responses were more coherent and made sense
- I know this is in part due to the sheer variety of data in there, but also having relevant responses would help answer my question credibly
- In my next experiment, I will add more data to see if this improves, but in my last test I will try a more rigorous training session to see if that improves the model at all, and worst case troubleshoot
