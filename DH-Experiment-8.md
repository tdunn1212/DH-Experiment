# This Time
- I want to add slightly more training data to see if it will increase the legibility of my model's responses

# Progress
- i managed to get the Final Fantasy 7 script, which will either be so big it derails training or so big it helps it! We will find out :)
- I had to mess around with saving a webpage, then converting it to PDF, then converting it to txt, which may cause problems but fingers crossed
- Our code from the Uncharted script will come in handy again too, since the script uses colons instead of line breaks
- I've decided to try out getting both Aerith and Tifa (the two main female characters and love interests) to see what happens
	- they are much more well-rounded in the remake from my understanding (which is the script I'm using, but still!)
- Aerith and Tifa both have over 680+ lines each! Which should help build my data bank but may also skew things

- Now onto training with our final additions
- My last major experiment with be making sure that I am prepared to try and answer my question, or to try and solve problems to make sure I am on track to answer my question in the future

# Next Steps
- I feel like these results are unfortunately a step backwards! 
- I think I may take the Final Fantasy characters out for sure, since their dialogue is shorter and often more specified, but I'm not sure who to add
- I think I'll comb online for various rom-com scripts, since those are probably lower stakes and more grounded in general reality
- Colab also says I've run out of free T4 runtime, so I might have to go back to VSCode, we'll see!
