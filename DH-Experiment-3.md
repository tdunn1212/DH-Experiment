# This Time...
In this experiment, I will be trying again, with a much smaller training process and a txt file modified to remove some of the JSON elements to get to AI GF adjacent territory. Then, I am going to try adding code to try and add a movie script for much more indepth training
## Experiment 2 
- I've uploaded another romanceable SDV character, Abigail, in a txt file without JSON elements
- Assuming this works, I will try with the movie script from Her in a txt file, parsed to only take dialogue from Samantha, the AI love interest
	- I think this should be my primary trajectory for the rest of the assignment presuming this works out
- I don't want unique text, I know this model doesn't get to it, but I want something that mimics a partner and changes its response depending on the prompt... which Haley did not do for me yesterday
	- Working with Her should help this slightly, since that involves much more text
- This time, going back to 100 steps VS 1000, it only took 5 minutes to train GPT2... much better for todays purpose!

- Results... a little better but not my much!
- I also reduced the text length to 50 characters instead of 100, so that the results would be more coherent 
	- the code did unfortunately break and I didn't understand the error here so I did have to get Gemini help...
	- Gemini made the problem worse... I think it knows I'm trying to critique its overlords. I made a duplicate file from scratch because I was getting too frustrated
- 2 files later... we have liftoff again
- I want to perform my next experiment in Visual Studio Code, hoping that it makes things less complicated. But for now, I'll see the results of the shortened output shortly!![](/images/4-08-02)
- this is something interesting that happened. I have no idea where this text came from, but here we are! The next sample had, thankfully, changed to the expected dialogue
- and the results with the shortened text length...... kind of funny, but on the right track!![](/images/4-08-03)

## Next time
- my next step is importing and parsing the Her movie script to get Samantha's dialogue and make a model based on it. I expect that this will be much harder and take the rest of my experiment
- I will also try to perform this code is VSCode to make things slightly easier ideally, but I don't know if this will pan out
